# Dotfiles

These should deploy easily on bare box. You only need `git` installed

`vimrc` should work withoud bundles installed.

Bundles are in `vim-update-bundles`-compatible format, although you don't
need it to install them. See `vim-clone-bundles` script.

# Requirements
* git (but you probably have it installed, already)

# Miscellaneous
* uses (gthank's script)[gthank/bundle-updater] for updating vim bundles
